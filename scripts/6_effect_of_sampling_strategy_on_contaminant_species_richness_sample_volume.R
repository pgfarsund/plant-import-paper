### 6_effect_of_sampling_strategy_on_contaminant_species_richness
### 2. sample volume

# we want to investigate the effect of sampling effort on the observed species 
# richness of contaminant plants and fungi identified by metabarcoding. we'll do
# this in two steps:

# we want to compare contaminant species detection between two sample volumes. 
# unfortunately, all our samples were approx. 25 grams each. we will therefore
# simulate a double soil volume by merging samples that came from the same pots 
# (i.e., 10 pots per container) PRIOR to normalizing reads, and compare the
# observed species richness to that of pots only sampled once.
