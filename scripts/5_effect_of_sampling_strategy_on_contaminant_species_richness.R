### 5_effect_of_sampling_strategy_on_contaminant_species_richness
### 1. sample interval

# we want to investigate the effect of sampling effort on the observed species 
# richness of contaminant plants and fungi identified by metabarcoding. we'll do
# this in two steps:

# we want to compare contaminant species detection between two sampling 
# strategies for obtaining 20 samples per container: sampling 20 pots once, or
# sampling 10 pots twice. 
# we're interested in 1) the total number of species identified by both 
# strategies, and 2) estimates of total richness based on the two strategies:
